That nobody I work with uses it. All of my team use Python and SQL and I cannot convince them of the power and convenience of R. For that reason, it is difficult for me to use it in some of the ways I would like because the knowledge share is limited.	10	Statistical analysis, Data transformation, Text processing, Survey analysis	NA	NA	The entire tidyverse.	I still have to use SPSS for survey data because it provides a specific style of output of aggregated data (in Excel) which is required for researchers writing reports. I understand why, but the same output does not really exist in any R package that I've seen. This means I end up processing (cleaning, setting up data variables for things like nets and banners, etc.) in R and then uploading that data to SPSS where I have to do labeling and setup for output. I do not like SPSS and particularly after learning R. It is clunky and feels like a product IBM doesn't care to modernize in any way.	NA	If I had seen directly (without having to figure it out for myself) how R makes tasks I was doing in Excel easier, it would have been way easier to convince me to get on board.

If I wanted a far more strictly typed language there are a million to choose from. Also coming from a stats background, it's just psychologically unsettling to me that in some other languages you have to explicitly load math libraries to perform some of the most rudimentary algebra operations. That tells me that R is where I ought to be. Other languages are TOO general to be ideal for my uses and are becomes more generally powerful all the time."	That too many people from other backgrounds are afraid of it. People will encounter it once in, say, an intro stats course from 15 years ago, and then choose to imagine that nothing has changed since. The language gets an undue bad rap from people who are misinformed and/or biased. It's hard to change the workplace and professional cultures that border, but are as yet uninvolved, with the world of R. The more critical mass it can achieve, the better. It's not an R problem so much as a problem of education and marketing.	10	Statistical analysis, Data transformation, Modeling, Visualization, Machine learning, Text processing	NA	NA	package development tools	NA	NA	inconsistent syntax in base R I was stuck with years ago.	1981	male	United States of America	White	Master’s degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)	0	Frequently -- I use version control on most of the code that I write	R Command Line (i.e., the native R terminal interface), RStudio Desktop (IDE), Shinyapps.io, Shiny Server	NA	Finding proper packages to use	NA	Early Learner	male	white	White	674

Seeing solid workflows from experts who really know the best practices in R would be helpful. It's easy to dive down a deep messy hole.

Some are hard to decipher.	10	Statistical analysis, Data transformation, Modeling, Visualization, Machine learning	NA	NA	tidyverse	An easy way to run basic statistical test and and get the output to be all of the critical stats/info you'd need. It seems like I can run any statistical test in R, but then I need to write multiple other lines of code to calculate things like R-squared (among other basic things). It would be way more user friendly and easier for beginners to enter into the R-world if running basic tests would by default spit out all the necessary info you'd want to report in a paper. For instance, sometimes it's much easier to run things on SPSS or SAS because when I run the tests, it outputs all the summary statistics I'd need.

"Coming from Python, I felt like I lost most of the tools of a programmer: loops and wider variety of data structures (dictionaries, sets, tuples, etc) and object-oriented programming. It was really frustrating for about the first month, each time I wanted to do a task I felt like I couldn't just /do/ it like I could in Python (even when beginning). I felt like I was spending all of my time just looking up the ""right"" function to do something specific I needed rather than just spending 10-15 minutes hashing it out in a for-loop with a dictionary, which felt super inefficient. I've gotten to the point after 6 months of R use that I've learned a critical mass of functions to have a decent workflow.

Furthermore, I felt like R documentation was generally much worse than Python documentation. It was always difficult for me to really get a sense of what types of objects were going in and out of functions."	8	Statistical analysis, Data transformation, Modeling, Visualization	NA	NA	Magrittr, and pipes specifically.

However, this has inspired me to learn D3 and replicate some of my R projects/graphics in D3. I'm enjoying D3 and in some ways I prefer it over R-based data viz packages. In that sense, I wish there was a better system to convert data.frames to json format. There are few packages available, but extract characters are often included in the file. This requires additional formatting in a text editor, which isn't reproducible.

I have struggled with using R for productionisation of analyses. Python seems to be a better tool when building production-ready models and workflows. I know that R can be used in this way as well, but I don't know enough to argue how it compares to Python, especially in response to Python experts who make the assertion that Python is the better tool.	10	Statistical analysis, Data transformation, Modeling, Visualization, Machine learning, Text processing, Exploratory data analysis	NA	NA	I love the magrittr/tidyverse piping workflow, but ggplot2 is absolutely essential for my work. Analogues in other languages fall considerably short, in my experience, in terms of ease of use and versatility.	For machine learning, in R the various packages all work differently with different syntax and different functions, without a unified logic. This is in contrast to SciKit Learn in Python, where it's easy to apply different algorithms to your analysis once you understand the general syntax. I think this is a blocker for a lot of people. I know that the caret package gets at this, but in my experience (admittedly from several years ago), caret runs slowly and can be a bit cumbersome to use with large amounts of data.

Never -- I don't write unit tests	Visualization, dplyr summaries, loops for building stuff (yes, I am trying to get into the map syntax, but since I am currently using several API calls within my loops, the map syntax quickly gets too complicated. But I LOVE the elegance of map). I also love the replicability of my analyses - I come from GUI usage of Excel and SPSS, and while SPSS syntax can be quite elegant for survey analysis, I think the return on investment is too small compared to improving my skills in R.	Hmmm. I think Tidyverse has been a big improvement, but it is sometimes difficult to keep up and follow best practice. Also, programming is inherently more satisfying but also much more complex than using e.g. SPSS, so I sometimes bump my head against my own incompetence and start fantasizing about a turnkey solution to my problems.	9	Statistical analysis, Data transformation, Visualization, Text processing, Survey analysis, I would vey much like to use R much more for survey analysis, but find that Tidyverse isn’t quite there, compared to e.g SPSS	NA	NA	ggplot.

Users have to stay on top of new developments, and often relearn skills they already possessed in order to to stay relevant.

Finally, the strongly statistically oriented community produces great plugins."	"Firstly : ""<-"" and ""%>%"" are annoyingly prolix syntaxes for such a frequently used item (as is ""=="" in C++ ); it makes you waste so much time while writing .
Secondly : the quasi-total lack of a standardised style/syntax increases enormously the frequency of errors (e.g. data.table is a great package but it behaves ever so slightly differently from data.frame  such  that it is very easy to mix the two syntaxes and generate errors which slow down the development). 
Thirdly :  it is complicated to go parallel with R (at least much harder than say in C or Python) and the lack of a decently working interface with spark (maybe sparklyr is getting better)  makes it hard to integrate R in a big data environment.
Fourthly : It is not suited for industrial production (at least less suited than python and even matlab/SAS) owing mostly to the lack of sufficient stability of packages and the way the environment and packages are organised (and the frequency of updates) and the lack of a proper compiler."	9	Statistical analysis, Data transformation, Modeling, Visualization, Machine learning	NA	NA	ggplot2, lubridate, dplyr, tydr	I should say mostly a proper,  succinct , native functional syntax (the scala one is much easier to deal with than the R one); Better typing ; and the ability to efficiently compile a project in a standalone executable (that would be so great for production purposes).

I don't know what unit tests are	There is a lot of documentation out there to do almost anything you’d like to do with R. It seems like the possibilities are endless. Generating graphs for publications also look so much better. There appear to be a lot of methods for automatically generating tables for publication, too, which I’m sure would be super handy but I haven’t yet gotten around to learning	I often use SPSS to run multiple analsyes at once. For example, I can select one way ANOVA and input a factor and choose multiple dependent variables to test and I receive output for all of them at once. With R, as far as I know, you have to run each ANOVA separately. I find it’s just a lot easier to have all the results in front of me at the one time. Another thing I prefer SPSS for is long to wide format restructuring. SPSS automatically puts variables that have the same value for all observations for each ID into a single variable, whereas transposing in R will create x variables for all variables regardless. For example, participant sex would be one column in the resultant SPSS wide format data set. But in R, there would be x number of sex columns, where x is the number of observations.  Anything else that comes to mind is more because of my lack of experience/understanding of how to do things rather than being an inherent issue with R.	9	Statistical analysis, Visualization	NA	NA	Ggplot2, lmer	Mentioned above. There’s another feature I’d really like to see - there’s one package that claims to do it but I haven’t been able to get it to work and the package creator hasn’t responded to my emails. I really wonder if there’s just a bug in that package. It’s the EMAtools package. I’d like to see a package that can calculate cohen’s d for each of the fixed effects in lmer functions. I’m most often interested in the effect size for two-level interactions	NA	Don’t know. I learn a lot from following code examples online. It makes it quite easy but sometimes it’s so easy to just “plug and play” that I don’t make enough effort to learn the mechanics of R because of it.

I don't know what unit tests are	(1) Once you get a sense of the grammar, the language is very intuitive. (2) Statistical analyses are more flexible, and also let you see under the hood, so that you're constantly reminding yourself of the logic of the test. (3) Once you have a script for a particular kind of analyses, R is MUCH faster than SPSS. (5) Easily controllable visualization in ggplot makes it much easier to do exploratory analyses. (6) The cheat sheets and vignettes for R make it easy to acquire new skills on an as-needed basis, and even boost my understanding of statistical techniques like power analysis through very directly manipulable examples.	(1) The lingo in much of the native documentation is still sort of frustratingly obtuse.

And sometimes there is simply no option at all. Need to communicate with syslog? Nope. (I wrote/released rsyslog to solve this.) Need to send something to a UDP socket (e.g. for statsd)? No luck. Need to communicate with RabbitMQ? Again, no luck. Admittedly, I ended up writing closed-source packages to fulfill these requirements at my own company, but until there are open-source versions available people will continue to encounter these problems."	NA	"Learn, I'm not sure. The most painful aspect of using R for me is the lack of adherence to (and tooling for) semantically-meaningful package versions. It's possible to roll your own solution to this, or use packrat or Docker to circumvent the problem, but until these features become part of the core language I think the ""management"" part of R's dependency management will continue to be daunting for anyone who needs their script to work reliably in five years' time, or who is responsible for the running of production R code."	1991	male	Canada	White	Master’s degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)	20	Frequently -- I use version control on most of the code that I write	EMACS ESS mode, R Command Line (i.e., the native R terminal interface), RStudio Connect, RStudio Server	NA	"Learning ""good"" R patterns and design principles."

The connections tab as part of the later versions of R-studio is useful. However it still doesn't seem to pull the full schema from my organisations SQL database. Still not sure if the issues is our side or whether the way it reads the schema through RODBC or ODBC connect but seems like this area could be improved, making R useful for making automated tools.

Markdown, the democratization of the open source platforms, and ability to generate products and tools (packages, shiny, etc.) easily from within the R framework.	The challenge relates to the strength - it is extremely hard to sift through much of the documentation online, especially pre-tidyverse or Base R answers, to get answers. I have figured that out for myself more from lots of trial and error, but I know it is extremely challenging for new users (whom I a teach).	10	Statistical analysis, Data transformation, Modeling, Visualization, Survey analysis	NA	NA	tidyverse	A solid (and flexible) approach to generating tables for applied statistical analysis results and papers: descriptive statistics, and particularly tables of regression results.  This is admittedly a challenge for other softwares for the same purpose, but their solutions are still vastly more robust (like outreg in Stata) and well documented than the current options in R.	NA	There are now clearer paths to learning R if you are substituting it for another statistical software, even in the last 2 years since I've learned, that would have been much easier (datacamp courses on modeling with tidyverse).  R might have supported that more explicitly and directly, to facilitate users from other common platforms (SAS, Stata, SPSS, etc.) to build from what they know rather than starting with vectors, objects, etc.	1981	male	United States of America	White	Doctorate (e.g. PhD, EdD)	10	Frequently -- I use version control on most of the code that I write	RStudio Desktop (IDE), RStudio Server	NA	Finding proper packages to use, Language syntax	NA	Recent Learner	male	white	White	2705

You need to have time to invest before you have to produce results from your analysis. The mapping functions have promise but honestly going back to coding when GIS has moved so far into friendly user interface is just painful. There's also so many rabbit holes where someone has a package that does one thing you need and you have to cobble it with something else. Or you get down do line 80 and realize that the package doesn't do what you thought it would or what you need. Or the package is out of date and would be awesome but doesn't work well. Finally, finding examples of code folks have run with packages is a pain.	3	Statistical analysis, Visualization	NA	NA	"spdep

I also know that's not the point and probably impossible with such a diverse user system, but having 80 different internet tabs open to multiple different places for one function is a pain. C-ran, Rpubs, github, UCLA, so many rando websites, etc. I know this sounds like I'm whining (I am) but really R is amazing. I wouldn't have suffered for 6 months to finally have it click if I didn't think it's phenomenal.	1981	female	United States of America	White	Master’s degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)	8	Never -- I don't use version control for my R code	Microsoft Excel, Python, Shinyapps.io	NA	There are multiple packages and ways to run very similar analysis, so finding the right package, knowing how to code in that package, and understanding the output were all hard. There's also very basic functions that are fast once you have the code written but can take multiple days to write. Producing a summary statistic table for example. Fast once you know how, took many days to figure it out. Also, coding map functions in R is a huge time suck compared to GIS, but the spatial analysis possibilities are so much better. I find myself switching between multiple softwares to save time even though R could do it all.	NA	Recent Learner	female	white	White	2820

"It's very frustrating to take code I've written and make it run parallel on multiple processors. I have only coded locally and haven't picked up using cloud/clusters.

I also don't have an easy way to code something that a non-R user can then run again at a future time.
