As my colleague put it: They teach us about half the alphabet, then they ask us to read but fail to mention that there's the entire rest of the alphabet we need to find out about ourselves. That is, way too many (most) of the tasks given required the student to find out for themselves if they could solve the task with the material in the lectures or if you were supposed to find more tools, packages, statistical theory etc on your own. Starting from scratch, with all problems you can encounter with packages and different versions etc, it isn't very nice to throw very dirty data at beginners and then not even telling them that they should be googling for additional information. Would not recommend this specialization to anyone. I did complete it though, it took med about a year and a half. After maybe five or six months I felt that I could make use of R in my work.
