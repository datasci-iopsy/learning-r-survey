With so many packages and documentation, I assume that I can do whatever I need to do. I typically use SAS but I feel limited with the lack of data visualization options so R provides some relief in that area.	I can get confused with packages and downloading them as I have run into cases where the package didn’t install properly. I also haven’t quite figured out how to efficiently clean or “wrangle” my data and the most useful package to use for that. Also, with packages it can be confusing to figure out the exact syntax to use, although r studio does help with that.

Also R is very elegant when a package or workflow already provides a nice solution for you, e.g. using ggplot2 with its many pre-defined plot types. However, it can quickly get messy and ugly if you want to do something that is different from the way the a package has defined for you. In comparison, Python sometimes requires a bit more work up-front (e.g. with visualization in matplotlib) but once you have mastered it, you can apply the same knowledge to so many other problems and you don't need to keep learning 'yet another package'.The lack of standardization in R, such as how package authors define the mechanics of their S3 classes (in comparison to Python, which already gives you a well defined structure to work with), means that the inconsistency can become fatiguing over time.

As my colleague put it: They teach us about half the alphabet, then they ask us to read but fail to mention that there's the entire rest of the alphabet we need to find out about ourselves. That is, way too many (most) of the tasks given required the student to find out for themselves if they could solve the task with the material in the lectures or if you were supposed to find more tools, packages, statistical theory etc on your own. Starting from scratch, with all problems you can encounter with packages and different versions etc, it isn't very nice to throw very dirty data at beginners and then not even telling them that they should be googling for additional information. Would not recommend this specialization to anyone. I did complete it though, it took med about a year and a half. After maybe five or six months I felt that I could make use of R in my work.

As far as RStudio is concerned, I feel it is hands down the best programming development environment out there. I've used jupyter notebooks, sublime, dabbled in atom, and now use VS code for all non-R languages, but even this feels a bit stodgy at times compared to RStudio. The only major edge VS Code has is that it better integrates Git version control more smoothly.	The fact that R does not neatly fit into any programming paradigm. Although it combines elements of functional and OOP, there are so many features that refute the core logic of both these paradigms which can lead to annoying edge cases. In a purely functional or OOP language, this wouldn't occur.

Also, I dislike having to choose either ""write-only"" syntax (with data.table) or limited functionality and poor performance (with dplyr). I am aware of dtplyr, which I view as the R equivalent of King Solomon cutting the baby in half.

Finally, RStudio is the only good IDE available, and while it's good for a browser-based IDE, the desktop version is really clunky as desktop IDEs go. The debugging functionality is significantly behind IDEs for other languages, and I disable features as basic as tab-complete and quote/paren pairing are too clumsy and inconsistent to really be helpful."
